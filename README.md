# TRAVL - Travel website
A travel website created with React Js and CSS. The goal of this project for me was to get familiar with some of the fundamentals of using React Hooks and React Router. While also learning the techniques of building a responsive website using media queries. 

The website can be found on [Netlify](https://nostalgic-hopper-ff2f23.netlify.app/)

## Key Learning Objectives
* [**React Router:**](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/getting-started/overview) to create a seamless SPA navigation 
* [**React Hooks:**](https://hu.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html) to manage component states and side effects
* [**Render Props:**](https://hu.reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html) to share the state or behavior that one component encapsulates to other components that need that same state
* **Flexbox & Media Queries:** to practice responsive website design
